* Start thinking about the schema for synthnmr

# What tables, columns, indexes, foreign keys do we need?

1. Data table (holds the raw matrices that the spectra are plotted from)
	- the actual numpy arrays 
2. ID system
	- how do you give each experiment, data record, a unique id
	- levels
		* experiment that you ran, or rather group of spectra
		* or individual per matrix?
		* what is tracked, at what level, group/experiment, or is per spectrum?

what is a group? versus experiment?

spectrum_dataset script -- this calls the generator many times. We would want to
know that all of those spectra are together in the same group. 

all the parameters are separate columns in the database. 
* parameters 
	number of points
	limits
	mode

what protein/structure we are trying to model

Just make a simple db with 1 table 
we ignore the group context
each row is a unique spectrum
number of points
interval size
and the mode
of course the raw data
	- store the numpy arrays as well as any png files that were created.


make a simple table with integer primary key and the number of points. and make
it in pure sql .sql file
